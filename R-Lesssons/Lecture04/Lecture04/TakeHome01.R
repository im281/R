#' Instructions
#' ============
#' This take home quiz consists of 28 problems with a total of 
#' 28 points. Please work individually: do not collaborate with anyone 
#' inside or outside of this class as this assignment is a preparation for the 
#' in-class exam. You may use your notes and lab exercises.
#'  
#' Please read through carefully, and complete the R code as instructed.  Type 
#' in your answers in this document in front of the lines that say "#' Answer:".
#' You can continue your answer on the following lines if it's long, but we're 
#' generally expecting brief answers.
#' 
#' If you add allowErrorsInNotebook() at some point, be sure to delete it before
#' you compile and turn in the final version of the notebook or you may miss R 
#' errors.
#' 
#' __Important:__ if you have problems with the R code, or with compiling your
#' notebook, email your TA or the instructor for help.  You are being tested on
#' biostatistical concepts and interpretation, not on your ability to program in
#' R.
#' 
#' When you are ready to submit
#' ----------------------------
#' 1. Make sure your name is in the "author:" field at the top of the document, 
#' (keep the quotes!)
#' 2. Click on File > Compile notebook... to create a word document from your
#' code. Check the word document for completeness
#' 3. If you used allowErrorsInNotebook(), don't forget to remove it before
#' the final run so you'll be sure to catch any errors.
#' 4. Upload the word document (not the R code!) to Blackboard. There will 
#' be a folder for take home 1.
#' 
#' This quiz will be graded and factored into your final course grade as
#' indicated in the syllabus.

#' 



#'
#' #### Question 4 (1pt)
#' From an analytic point of view, do you see potential problems with this
#' variable?

summary(wt) 


#' Answer: 
#' 
#' 
#' 



#'
#' #### Question 9 (1pt)
#' How would you describe the distribution of birth weights:
#' a) more or less symmetric,  b) severely skewed to the left, 
#' or c) severely skewed to the right?

#' Infant's Gestational Age (variable gestation)
#' =============================================
#' The gestational age is the duration of the pregnancy in weeks, measured from
#' the first day of the mother's last menstrual cycle to the current date (the

#' weeks. Infants born before 37 weeks are considered preterm or premature.
#' Births after 42 weeks are considered postterm.


#'
#' #### Question 10 (1pt)
#' Get a histogram of gestation age (variable gestation)
hist(gestation) 


#'
#' #### Question 11 (1pt)
#' What is the median gestation age?
#' 
boxplot(gestation)
median(gestation,na.rm = TRUE)

#' Answer: 
#' 
#' 
#' 



#'
#' #### Question 12 (1pt)

#' gestational age, on the high end, or both ends?
#' 

#' Answer: 
#' both ends
#' 
#'

#'

#' Answer: 
#'
